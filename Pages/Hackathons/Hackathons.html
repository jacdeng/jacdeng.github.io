							<h2>Hackathons</h2>
							<p> Hackathons are sprint events (usually lasting 24 hrs) where people involved with software development get together and develop a solution that can solve real world problems.
								I've attended various hackathons to learn, have fun and meet new people.

								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p> Hackathons are my introduction to the world of software developments, albeit, a rough one. At the beginning of the second year, I attended my first hackathon but absolutely no knowledge in
									development at all. I picked up Android Studio and saw some really interesting ideas. Over the rest of 2nd year and the beginning of 3rd year, I attended 2 more hackathons before realizing that
									staying up all night stressing about the project is really not my style. However, the lure of interesting ideas and new friends kept me visiting hackathons even if I am not making a project.
									<br><br>

								<h3>VANquish Collisions Hackathon (Sep 2018)</h3>
								<p> My first Hackathon. A true train wreck.

									The goal of the hackathon is to come up with solutions that will move us more quickly towards zero transportation related fatalities and serious injury goal. Especially focusing on vulnerable 
									road users like seniors and childrern. It was hosted by the City of Vancouver in 2018. <br> <br>
									Our solution was making an app that would help communities report reckless behavior in driving and directly report it to local authorities. We could not finish the app in the end but it
									was a good learning experience with android studio.
									
								</p>

								<h3>NWhacks (Jan 2019)</h3>
								<p> NWhacks is hosted by UBC every year, it is the largest hackathon in western Canada. It is a very open playing field with many sponsors and themes you can address. For 2019, with a team of 4, we
									focused on putting our skills we learnt to the use. 
									<br> <br>
									We creacted an app that could quickly help groups of people plan how to share their rides and named it WeGo. You can read more about it <a href="https://devpost.com/software/wego-v4697y">here</a> on devpost.
								</p>

								<p>
									We won Telus' sustainable cities award and was invited to check out their innovation center. It was a great experience seeing what they were up to and all the interesting things we can achieve with technology.

								<h3>DUBhacks (Oct 2019)</h3>
								<p> DUBhacks is hosted by UWashington every year. It is a bit of a smaller hackathon but has lots of sponsors that brings many interesting ideas and technologies with them. We decided to attend the
									hackathon despite it being a 4 hour drive away. Unable to pull an all-nighter, we focused more on learning and getting to know new ideas.
									<br> <br>
									We created an app that helped improve accessibility in unknown spaces for disabled people by recognizing and reading out signs and named it EyeGo. You can read more about it <a href="https://devpost.com/software/eyego">here</a> on devpost.
